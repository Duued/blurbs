# A simple guide as to how app commands work
## This isn't a tutorial

<p>Your bot has a "command tree" which tells Discord what app commands are in your bot. You "sync" it to discord so it knows there's an update. 

There is two parts to the command tree handling
<ol>
  <li>Discord Sending the Command to the bot</li>
  <li>The bot processing the command and giving a response to Discord</li>
</ol>
</p>
